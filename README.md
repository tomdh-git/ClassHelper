# ClassHelper
Made by Dasan Tom
Input classes and get optimized schedules! Add your preferences too, to get more specific schedules!

How to use:
1. Install Selenium (controls google chrome to look for classes) (wont steal your info i promise)
2. Run the ClassHelper.py script
3. On your first run, itll make all the files for you. Now check the folder and youll have two different files.
4. Input classes in "courses.txt". Specify your preferences in "preferences.txt." (for picky people like me)
5. Run ClassHelper.py again.
6. Enjoy your schedules!

Current Preferences:
1. Preferred start and end for your schedules:
Let's say you want to start your day off at 10:00am and end at 4:30pm. Specify these times in preferences.txt to limit your schedule outputs and help you narrow it down! This setting requires an input like 10:00am or 4:30pm.
3. Optimization based on weekly free time:
Wanna sort your schedule outputs based on how much free time youll have throughout the week? Now you can! This setting requires an input of True or False.
4. Multithreading:
Have a good computer and wanna do everything super fast? Now you can! For fast and heavy duty CPUs only! This setting requires an input of True of False.
