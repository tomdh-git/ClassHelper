1. Preferred start and end for your schedules:
Let's say you want to start your day off at 10:00am and end at 4:30pm. Specify these times in preferences.txt to limit your schedule outputs and help you narrow it down! This setting requires an input like 10:00am or 4:30pm.
3. Optimization based on weekly free time:
Wanna sort your schedule outputs based on how much free time youll have throughout the week? Now you can! This setting requires an input of True or False.
4. Multithreading:
Have a good computer and wanna do everything super fast? Now you can! For fast and heavy duty CPUs only! This setting requires an input of True of False.
